# How should I start

## Without Docker
  1. install required dependencies by running the `bundle install` command
  2. create the database using the `rake db:create` command
  3. apply migrations to the database using the `rake db:migrate` command
  4. run tests by executing the `bin/rails test -v` command
  5. run the `bin/rails server` command to see whether the server starts

## Using Docker
  1. build dev image: `docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t dna-app-dev .`
  2. run image: `docker run --name dna-app-dev -p 3000:3000 dna-app-dev`
  3. run tests: `docker exec -it dna-app-dev rails test -v`

# Scenario
Letâ€™s imagine you are working on API for backend of an online payment system.
The actors are: users (festival participants), merchants, event organiser.
We want to enable backoffice operations to the event organiser.

Currently implemented:
- Users can make a payment (with a virtual currency) to a specific merchant.
- Our system has a payment log.
- It means that information about payments are stored in a database.
- This data can be used for reporting.

# Tasks
## Task 1:
Please make a code review of the currently implemented solution.
## Task 2:
Add new endpoint which give total income for payments for selected time period for given merchant.
