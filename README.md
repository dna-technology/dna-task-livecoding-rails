## Scenario
Letâ€™s imagine you are working on API for backend of an online payment system.
The actors are: users (festival participants), merchants, event organiser.
We want to enable backoffice operations to the event organiser.

Currently implemented:

- Our system has a payment log.
- It means that information about payments are stored in a database.
- This data can be used for reporting.

# Tasks
## Task 1:
Please make a code review of the currently implemented solution.
## Task 2:
Add new endpoint which give total income for payments for selected time period for given merchant.
